Is there a correlation betwween 3-point shots ability and winning precentage?

## Overview



Since I was a child, I have watched the NBA. Nowadys, the basketball league is in the middle of a revolution that more and more teams are willing to take 3-point shots. In my project, I try to explore if taking 3-point shots can really maximize offensive efficiency by improving each team's winning precentage. In other words, I want to know if there is a correlation between 3-point shots ability and winning precentage.

## Exploratory Analysis
As we have seen in the nba, those teams who are good at shooting threes usually have a better precentage of winning the game. For the recent five years, we can find that teams are more liely to attempt 3 pointers. Our task in this project is to find the real reason why most of the teams are attempting 3 pointers knowadays.
We will dig into the relationship between 3 pointers and winning record on my first graph. Then, we will analyze the winning precentage and three pointer attempted of Houston which is the best 3 pointer team in the league.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
nba_2017 <- filter(nba, season == 2017)
nba_2017
ggplot(nba_2017, aes(threepointer_precentage, winning_precentage)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=team_name), size=5) +
  ggtitle("the effect of threepointer precentage on winning precentage") +
  annotate("text", x = 0.386, y = 0.759, label = "the best 3pointer team" ) +
  annotate("text", x = 0.366, y = 0.772, label = "the team winning the most") +
  annotate("text", x = 0.342, y = 0.305, label = "worst team and 3pointer team")

ggplotly()
```

```{r}
rocket <- filter(nba, team_name == "Houston")
rocket
ggplot(rocket, aes(season, winning_precentage)) +
  geom_point(aes(size=number_of_threepointer_attempts), color="red") +
  geom_line()

```

## Conclusion

From the first graph, we can clearly see a relationship between each team's winning precentage and threepointer's precentage. As more 3 shots are made, a team has a greater chance of winning. In the second graph, we can conclude from Houston that the increasing amount of three pointer increse the possibility of winning.
